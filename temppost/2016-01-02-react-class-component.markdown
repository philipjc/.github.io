Hello and a happy (React) new to you. I hope you all had fun hacking away over the holidays, I know I did. In this post, I am going to show you how to create a few simple React components using the ES2015 class syntax. This way of creating React components is not popular with everyone, but I still think it's good to know and quite enjoy using it. I believe its lack of popularity with some fine folks is due to the ongoing debate about JavaScript being prototypical language, and using class syntax avoids understanding this. I personally like to understand both ends of a spectrum.

Setting up React and Babel takes a little time (as does all setup) fortunately, there are plenty of good bootstrapping projects out there. I will be using my creation, and one I have recently blogged about, you can find it here: [react-boot]

Looking over the source code of my Git repo, you will notice there is already a React component using class syntax named component.jsx.
